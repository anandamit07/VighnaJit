Obstacle-Avoiding-Bot

The goal of Project is *Simple*, to come up with a **basic model** and the **best possible algorithm** to achieve obstacle detection and avoiding them **using only one sensor,servo and two-wheel control system**.

## Components Required
- Arduino NANO or Uno (any version)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- LM298N Motor Driver Module
- Servo
- 5V DC Motors
- Battery
- Wheels
- Jumper Wires

## Applications
- Used in mobile robot navigation systems.
- Used for household work like automatic vaccum cleaning.
- Used in dangerous environmemts,where human penetration could be fatal.
